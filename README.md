## ðŸ“œ About
A Loop Pedal simulator with intuitive control through facial expressions captured by webcam. A loop pedal allows you to record sounds and it plays them in loops on top of each other, the problema is, a website to simulate a loop pedal controlled by clicks wouldn't be very pratical (since the hands are generally busy playing ðŸ˜…), so I had to rethink the control strategy, and decided to go with facial recognition.
